# hlbsp2obj
Program allows you to convert half-life's `.bsp` to `.obj` file
## How it works
Build (`cargo build --release`) and run with `--help` or `-h` to get help info.
## TO-DO list
- [x] **map convertation**: Works fine, triangulation is possible using `-t` flag. 
- [ ] **normals and uv-s export**: Normals work fine, but aren't writed. UV-s are currently unsupported.
- [ ] **textures export & mtl files**: Not done yet.
